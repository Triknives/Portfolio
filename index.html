    <h2>About Me, And How I Got Here</h2>
    <p>For the past 10 years, I have been working in the Mental Health sector in the Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington area. I initially started in field as a Lifeline Volunteer Operator, which is a suicide prevention support service located in the Portland area which provided support to calls across the nation. Upon finishing my Masters in Marriage, Couple and Family Therapy I worked as a Child and Family Therapist for the past 5 years. After many challenging, and positive experiences I wanted to  take my skills acquired, and unique perspectives to explore other fields that could further provide unique challenges, while also allowing me to continue engaging in activities I enjoy and being a part of a new community. I have always had an interest in web development ever since the creation of the first over the top geocities page with aggregious amounts of sparks and ofcourse, animated...tiled...background.</p>
