      <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Brett Cordell, and I've just recently started to explore web-development, and other areas of coding. On this page, I will have some examples of projects I have completed, showing my progress throughout my learning experience at Epicodus. I have also put a bit of information about myself here as well. If you have any comments, suggestions or even concerns please <a href="mailto:cordell.desu@gmail.com"><span><strong>E-mail</strong></span></a> me and I will do my best to respond to any inquiries. Thanks again, and enjoy your visit.</p>
      <h2>About Me, And How I Got Here</h2>
      <p>For the past 10 years, I have been working in the Mental Health sector in the Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington area. I initially started in field as a Lifeline Volunteer Operator, which is a suicide prevention support service located in the Portland area which provided support to calls across the nation. Upon finishing my Masters in Marriage, Couple and Family Therapy I worked as a Child and Family Therapist. After 5 years in mental health in a professional role, I have experienced many challenging, and positive experiences. I wanted to  take my skills, and unique perspectives to explore other fields that could further provide unique challenges, and opportunities for growth. While also allowing me to continue engaging in activities I enjoy and being a part of a new community. I have always had an interest in web-development ever since the creation of the first over the top geocities pages with egregious amounts of sparks and ofcourse, animated...tiled...backgrounds.</p>
