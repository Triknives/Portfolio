# _Portfolio Landing Page_

#### _This is the initial landing for the my Portfolio page, _10/18/2019_

#### By _**Brett Cordell**_

## Description

_This page is specifically designed as a practice landing page for the Portfolio section of my website. It will be updated frequently with most recent projects, or projects that best represent the skills I wish to showcase to future employers.

This page was further created to better demonstrate the use of basic HTML and CSS when building a website. Bootstrap was also utilized in this project to better explore further elements that can be utilized and edited quickly during site creation._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone or download Git files provided._
* _Open with desired Text editor (I used Atom)._
* _Set-up your own repositories, and branches to edit and add as needed._

## Known Bugs

_{While at this time there are no specific bugs effecting the site, aside from some stray margins to be tinkered with, I would like to take a moment to reflect on what could have been done differently. I feel that this type of set up or landing page would best be structured in a GRID display. As it would allow for better adjustments of the content, and elements while providing a solid clean structure to work with. I would further like to see the "Projects" list broken into separate panels and given ample space for descriptions. }_

## Support and contact details

_If you have any concerns, comments or even suggestions on how to better organize or utilizing the code on this landing page, please contact me at Cordell.desu@gmail.com_

## Technologies Used

_{While this page specifically did aim to limit Technologies used to HTML/CSS, efforts were made to have elements that were of different type, and appearance to flow in a way that it appeared that they were in fact the same. Such as blending Box properties in to Well properties. Such as borders, and flow.}_
